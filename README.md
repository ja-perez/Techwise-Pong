## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Windows 10 or higher
### Release
The quickest way to get playing is to download the latest release on the repositories GitHub page.
This downloads a zip file which you can then unzip wherever you like and run the executable called "pong".

### Source
If you want to run the source code, you can clone the repository and install the required packages found in the 
requirements.txt file.
We recommend using a venv to install the required packages. This can be done by running the following commands in the 
root directory of the cloned project:
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the required packages are installed, you can then start the game by running the pong.py file in the "src" directory.

Note: You may have to set the current working directory to "src" before running the pong.py file for some asset paths to
work correctly.

## Project status
This project was made as part of Talentsprint's Techwise program and is not actively being maintained.
The release titled "Final Presentation" is the working version of the project presented during the course.
